# intro-funct-analysis
I am spending some time over my winter break to start learning relevant nonlinear functional analysis results that may aid me in future research. 
The idea is to read Deimling and use the supplemental resources to fill in the gaps. I may post my thoughts and examples as separate files in this repository.

My focal resource is:
1)  Deimling - "Nonlinear Functional Analysis" - Chapter 1

Supplemental Resources:
1)   Royden & Fitzpatrick - "Real Analysis" - Chapter 14
2)   Kreyszig - "Introduction to Functional Analysis with Application"

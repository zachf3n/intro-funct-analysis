# intro-funct-analysis
I am spending some time over my winter break to start learning some relevant nonlinear functional analysis results that may aide me in research topics. 
The idea is to read Deimling and use the supplemental resources to fill in the gaps.

My focal resource is:
1)  Deimling - "Nonlinear Functional Analysis" - Chapter 1

Supplemental Resources:
2)  Royden & Fitzpatrick - "Real Analysis" - Chapter 14
3)  Kreyszig - "Introduction to Functional Analysis with Application"
